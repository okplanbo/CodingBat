/*
We'll say that an element in an array is "alone" if there are values before and after it, 
and those values are different from it. Return a version of the given array where every 
instance of the given value which is alone is replaced by whichever value to its left or 
right is larger.

notAlone([1, 2, 3], 2) → [1, 3, 3]
notAlone([1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2], 2) → [1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 2]
notAlone([3, 4], 3) → [3, 4]
